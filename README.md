# WHERE_DIS

Here we go again. It's README time. Here we have the alpha version of Where_Dis. We were set out on a task by our bootcamp instructors to team up and construct a simple Django app. We responded with "Eff_dat! Let's make something awesome!" 

We brainstormed and came up with what we thought was a pretty good idea: we'll let a user upload a photo, we'll grab its location, and send other users out to find where that photo was taken. We managed to do exactly that. Not bad for a trio of beginning coders over the course of a few days, huh?

## How do I play Where_Dis?

Well, do you want to see how it works? [Well check the app here!](https://wheredis.herokuapp.com/) 

Our current metadata-extraction method only works on JPG files, so please [make sure your device is set to save images as JPGs](https://osxdaily.com/2017/09/29/change-iphone-camera-default-image-format-jpeg-heif/) and that location services are permitted for your camera. Then, how you play is up to you! You be a 'photo stasher' and upload an interesting photo to send people out to find, or you could be a chaser and use your knowledge and wit to find photos posted by others. Our preferred method is a healthy mix of each.

## How was it built?

On a Friday, we came up with our idea. Over that weekend we made a [pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MwuYV46KXCJfgakpwhlienAIksULUSt4cQy_Oi7HY2Q/edit#slide=id.g8a97be000a_0_0) and pitched the idea on Monday. (If you're wondering what the heck is going on with the first slide, we weren't sure we were going to pull this off, so we refused to tell our classmates and said we were making a "Big Cat Collector". Sure this is hard to explain, but Joe Exotic was super relevant at the time.) The rest of Monday through Thursday we mob-coded our way through this. We coordinated our efforts by checking items off of [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/bgSl0Nb3/wheredis).  We all seem to agree that we made something pretty awesome. There's a darn good chance that we'll turn this into a functioning website when it's all said and done!

To build this app, we used the following technologies:
- Python
- Django
- Good ol' fashioned math
- The rest of the tech

## How does it look?

We really like what we did with the design! Here's what we did with the general design:

Here's it on mobile:

## Next Steps

The following items should be implemented in future versions. They are ordered by a combination of importance and cool factor:
- Downsaving the photos and optimizing our location-extraction process to increase the speed of play
- Stripping the metadata from uploaded photos to stop all of you cheaters.
- Implement better means of communication between users
- Add a friends feature
- Maybe private games
- Video??!?
- Some sort of ranking system
- Create a much better sorting method for the games. Maybe even just limit to those nearby
- Find a nice little space for some ads
