For this page: 
1. Create new game using name field
2. Do we want a description field for hints?
3. Need to upload photo and grab lat and long
4. Probably spit out error if no lat and long


Notes:
• Create game first, since Photo needs game as a reference key. 
• Pull User from logged-in User
• Winner = null
• Upload image
• set photo.is_reference = True
• lat, long from image updates GameInstance model
