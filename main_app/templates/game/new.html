For this page: 
1. Need to upload photo and grab lat and long
2. Probably spit out error if no lat and long
3. Create new game using name field
4. Do we want a description field for hints?


Notes:
• Pretty sure we'll need to create the photo first. Should we do that as a seperate view, then pass the image to the next view?
• Pull User from logged-in User
• Winner = null
• lat, long from image
